Simon says is a memory game.
As straightforward as it is, this version incorporates define pitches from the marimba and the sound does not coordinate with the blinks.

The pitches are Perfect 5ths and tritones. Our listening are very acustomed to 4th and 5 pitches but not tri-tones or diminished interval.

Instructions:
1. Power on like the physical device
2. Click Start button to play
3. Fierce button will not allow you to repeat your round if you make a mistake. You will have to restart fromn round 1.
